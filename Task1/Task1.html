                <p>University Student Data Registration</p>
                <div><b>Frontend Development | Local Storage Integration</b> <br> <br> I developed a fully functional University Student Data Registration Application as a frontend project. The application enables users to efficiently register student 
                    details through an interactive and user-friendly interface. <br><br> This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on clean design and smooth user experience.
                    The registered student data is stored and managed using local storage, ensuring that the information is retained even when the page is refreshed.
                    <br><br> Throughout this project, I emphasized responsive design, proper form validation, and seamless navigation between pages. I also practiced efficient data handling, 
                    DOM manipulation, and storage retrieval techniques to ensure smooth functionality.
                    This project helped me enhance my skills in local storage management, page-to-page data transfer, and frontend logic development. <br><br>It also provided valuable experience in structuring 
                    HTML forms, writing clean JavaScript functions, and designing intuitive user flows.
                    By completing this project, I gained practical exposure to building real-world form-based applications and strengthened my abilities in critical thinking,
                     problem-solving, and effective UI development.</div>

                <p>Office To Do List Application</p>
                <div><b>Frontend Development | Task Management System <br><br>I developed an interactive To-Do List Application 
                    specifically designed for office team task management. This project allows users to seamlessly add, track, edit, 
                    and delete tasks in a visually organized interface. <br><br>The application automatically segregates tasks into four distinct categories: New Task, 
                    Scheduled Task, In-Progress Task, and Completed Task, enabling smooth task tracking and prioritization. The application is built using HTML, CSS, 
                    and JavaScript, with a focus on clean UI design and practical usability. <br><br>Each task card displays the task details, assigned 
                    team member, and due date, making it easy to monitor team progress at a glance. It features an add new task functionality, a search option for
                     quick filtering, and fully working edit and delete options to manage task updates and removals.<br><br> The project enhances user experience 
                     by providing real-time updates and easy task transitions between categories.<br><br> Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in 
                     DOM manipulation, local storage management, and dynamic content rendering. It also helped me strengthen my skills in problem-solving, 
                     critical thinking, and user-centric design.</div>
